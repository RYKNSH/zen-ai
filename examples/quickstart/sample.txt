ZEN AI is an open-source SDK for building autonomous AI agents.

It uses a "Present-Moment" architecture inspired by Zen Buddhism and rocket guidance systems.
The core idea is simple: rather than accumulating context over time (which leads to bloated, 
hallucination-prone agents), ZEN AI agents focus only on three things:

1. GOAL — The immutable destination
2. Snapshot — The current state of the world
3. Delta — The gap between Goal and Snapshot

When a milestone is reached, the agent performs a "Context Reset" — discarding all chat 
history and intermediate state. Only failure knowledge (in the form of "conditional proverbs") 
survives the reset, ensuring the agent stays lightweight and focused.

Key features:
- Milestone-based context management
- Failure-only memory (success is disposable, failure is universal)
- LLM-agnostic design (works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or local models)
- Built-in tools (file, shell, HTTP)
- Type-safe event system
